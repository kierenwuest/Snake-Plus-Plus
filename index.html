    <h3>üêç Game Info:</h3>
    <li>Snakes head is orange and starts in the center.</li>
    <li>To be played on desktop computer.</li>
    <li>Use keyboard arrow keys to move.</li>
    <li>Press Enter to reset the game board.</li>
    <li>Space will stop the snake.</li>
    <li>The snake likes to eat coloured dots.</li>
    <li>
      Eating a dot will give a score and snakes tail will grow the same length
      as the score.
    </li>
    <li>Red dots score between 1-5 and increase speed by 10px/s.</li>
    <li>
      Purple dots appear after score 8, score between 1-7 and increase speed by
      10px/s.
    </li>
    <li>
      Yellow dots appear after score 30, score between 1-10 and increase speed
      by 20px/s.
    </li>
    <li>
      Orange dots appear atfter score 40, score between 1-5 and increase speed
      by 0px/s.
    </li>
    <li>
      Wild dots appear after score 50, score between 1-10 and decrease speed by
      20px/s.
    </li>

    <h3>üíÄ Bugs I'm trying to work out:</h3>
    <li>
      Sometimes(rare/intermittent) the snake will crash into its own direction
      even though I tried to prevent this from happening. Control code for fast
      changes within the 10th sec interval will not prevent a self impact.
    </li>
    <li>
      Sometimes(rare/intermittent) coloured dots will randomly appear in info
      table. Not sure why, gussing a script order issue.
    </li>

    <h3>üéØ Roadmap:</h3>

    <li>IN PROGRESS: Teleport walls, instead of solid.</li>
    <li>
      IN PROGRESS: Create random obstacles in white shape outline (mayble like
      tetris blocks). Don't allow dots to spawn in them.
    </li>
    <li>
      Create some fancy css particle effects, make styling more retro arcade.
    </li>
    <li>
      Implement better more sopisticated sound behavior, JS audio context is
      complicated.
    </li>
    <li>Project some light x y lines coming from dots.</li>

    <li>Some kind of gameplay tweak pre-collision for high speed play.</li>
    <li>Create bigger dots basedon the random 1-5 score.</li>
    <li>Create mobile touch controls and responsive resizing.</li>
    <li>
      Some kind of celebration at score 100, confetti and sound effcts or
      something.
    </li>
    <li>Add windows gamepad support</li>
    <li>
      Create some movement/shudder for the snake head to give it character.
    </li>
    <li>Create Bad Guy computer snake with primative AI movements</li>
    <li>Create Game Over bouns multiplier score sequence</li>
    <li>Create Start Game intro screen with graphic and music</li>
    <li>Review and refactor code.</li>

    <h3>‚úîÔ∏è Done ++:</h3>
    <li><s>Create dynamic wider grid for desktop.</s></li>
    <li><s>Make movement speed smoother, more accurate literal speed.</s></li>
    <li><s>Make grid 10x10 pixels.</s></li>
    <li><s>Add a visual gird.</s></li>
    <li><s>Add new snake food (Dots).</s></li>
    <li><s>Add speed level and separate random score range.</s></li>
    <li><s>Make score taillength.</s></li>
    <li><s>Add sound effects for eating dots.</s></li>
    <li><s>Add info panel as canvas alongside.</s></li>
    <li><s>Add snake coords.</s></li>
    <li><s>Add collected dots to info panel.</s></li>
    <li><s>Add gane info, bugs and features to html and style fonts.</s></li>
    <li><s>Add score level and speed to different dots.</s></li>
    <li>
      <s
        >BUG: When I tired to implement wildcard dot feature, somehow the first
        dot triggers all dots on the first red dot colision. This was due to
        implmenting the initialiasation of the random co-ord as a variable.</s

    </li>
    <li>
      <s
        >Some kind of final special wild card Dot,that cycles colours, and that
        reduces speed or does something special or random.</s
      >
    </li>
    <li>
      <s
        >BUG: Sometimes(rare/intermittent) the coloured dots spawn out of
        bounds(or not at all), when I've tried to constrain them in the play
        area.</s
